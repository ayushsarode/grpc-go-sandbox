Learning gRPC in go. 


In this demo I have implemented gRPC RPC type
- Unary RPC: the client sends a single request and receives a single response.
- Server streaming RPC: the client sends a single request and in return, the server sends a stream of messages.
- Client streaming RPC: the client sends a stream of messages and the server responds with a single message.
- Bidirectional streaming RPC: in bidirectional streaming, both client and server send a stream of messages.
